# Guides

When getting started with Sinatra or Padrino for the first time, we recommend
that you check out the [Getting Started](/guides/getting-started) guide which
provides an overview of the rest of our resources. Also be sure to check out the
[Blog Tutorial](/guides/blog-tutorial) for a step-by-step walkthrough of
building your first Padrino project.

Padrino consists of multiple modules which enhance Sinatra in different ways.
The major components are described in detail below:

* [Getting Started](/guides/getting-started)
* [Generators](/guides/generators)
* [Application Helpers](/guides/application-helpers)
* [Controllers and Routing](/guides/controllers)
* [Development and Terminal Commands](/guides/development-commands)
* [Mounting Sub-applications](/guides/mounting-applications)
* [Delivering Mail](/guides/padrino-mailer)
* [Admin and Authentication](/guides/padrino-admin)
* [Site Caching](/guides/caching-support)

Note that as a user of Padrino, each of the major components can be used
[standalone](/guides/standalone-usage-in-sinatra) in an existing Sinatra
application or used together for a full-stack Padrino project.
