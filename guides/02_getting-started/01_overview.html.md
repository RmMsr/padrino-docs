# Overview

This is a guide intended for a developer that is just getting started with the
Padrino web framework (and perhaps Sinatra or Ruby). This guide will give an
overview the various other guides, resources and steps towards becoming a
Sinatra + Padrino aficionado.

You may want to skim through sections you already are familiar with. If you are
already familiar with Padrino and just want to access reference materials,
you may want to jump to [our api docs](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/padrino/padrino-framework "our api docs").
or the [guides homepage](/guides/ "guides homepage")
